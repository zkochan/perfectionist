# Planned Lints

This directory enumerates lints that `perfectionist` should provide. Each rule
is captured in its own file and was extracted from one or both of:

- [parallel-disk-usage `CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/KSXGitHub/parallel-disk-usage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [pacquet `CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md`](https://github.com/pnpm/pacquet/blob/main/CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md)

Every rule listed here is judged feasible to detect with a Dylint
`LateLintPass` (or `EarlyLintPass`) backed by `clippy_utils`. Rules from the
source documents that are *not* mechanically checkable are listed at the bottom
of this file.

Cross-cutting implementation conventions — including the parser-combinator
pattern that several rules call out by reference — live in
[`IMPLEMENTATION_CONVENTIONS.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_CONVENTIONS.md).

## Index

### Imports
- [`private-reexport-imports.md`](./private-reexport-imports.md) — flag
  a named `use` that reaches its item through a *private* re-export (a
  non-`pub` `use` in another module reached via ancestor privilege,
  e.g. `use super::Thing;` where the parent only privately `use`d
  `Thing`); suggest importing from the definition or a `pub use`
  re-export instead. Closes the gap `unused_imports` cannot see. Active
  by default.

### Naming
- [`path-qualification-mismatch.md`](./path-qualification-mismatch.md) — decide whether items from
  outside the current scope are named by their full path
  (`std::fs::create_dir_all`, `#[derive(clap::Parser)]`) or imported
  via `use` and called by the simple identifier. AI tends to produce
  the former; parallel-disk-usage prefers the latter. Inactive by
  default; opt in and pick `unqualified` or `qualified`.

### Trait bounds and signatures
- [`excessive-inline-bounds.md`](./excessive-inline-bounds.md) — prefer `where` clauses
  over inline bounds when there are multiple constraints.
- [`needless-borrowed-parameters.md`](./needless-borrowed-parameters.md) — when a
  function takes `&T` but the body unconditionally calls
  `.to_owned()` / `.to_path_buf()` / equivalent, take `T` directly.
  Test code and build scripts are exempt by default, since neither
  collects on the copy the owned signature saves. Pairs with
  `clippy::ptr_arg` and `clippy::needless_pass_by_value` to cover the
  full owned-vs-borrowed trade-off from the pacquet guide.

### OS strings, paths, and bytes
- [`needless-utf8-conversion.md`](./needless-utf8-conversion.md)
  — flag a fidelity-destroying UTF-8 conversion of a value whose
  native form is not UTF-8 — an OS string (`OsStr` / `OsString` /
  `Path` / `PathBuf`: `to_string_lossy()`, `to_str().unwrap()`,
  `display().to_string()`) or a byte buffer (`[u8]` / `Vec<u8>`:
  `String::from_utf8_lossy()`, `from_utf8().unwrap()`) — whose result
  feeds a sink that already accepts the native form (`AsRef<OsStr>` /
  `AsRef<Path>`: `Command::arg`, `command-extra`'s `CommandExtra`
  builder, `Path::join`, `File::open`, …). The lossy form silently
  corrupts non-UTF-8 input; the `unwrap` form panics on it. Byte
  sinks (`fs::write`, plus byte-buffer sources) are opt-in behind
  `include_byte_sinks`; conversions whose non-UTF-8 case is *handled*
  (`?` / `ok_or` / let-else) but still feed a sink are exempt by
  default and opt-in behind `include_handled_conversions`.
  `CStr`/`CString` are out of scope (FFI-shaped; satisfy no sink
  bound). Active by default.

### Derives and error types
- [`error-type-derives.md`](./error-type-derives.md) — derive
  `derive_more::Display` / `Error` only when needed; flag superfluous
  `Error` and types that violate the project's error-naming convention.
- [`manual-derive-more-impl.md`](./manual-derive-more-impl.md) — flag hand-written
  `impl` blocks that could be replaced by a `derive_more` derive
  (`From`, `Into`, `AsRef`, `Deref`, etc., with `Display` and
  `Error` available behind opt-in flags due to detection difficulty).
- [`uninlined-derive-more-args.md`](./uninlined-derive-more-args.md) —
  `clippy::uninlined_format_args` for `#[display(...)]` and
  `#[debug(...)]` attributes from `derive_more`.

### Pipe trait
- [`pipe-style.md`](./pipe-style.md) — bidirectional pipe-trait
  policy. Flags `value.pipe(f)` at the start of a chain (suggests
  `f(value)`), flags `f(chain)` wrapping a method chain (suggests
  `chain.pipe(f)`), flags `f(&chain)` / `f(&mut chain)` wrapping a
  borrow of one (suggests `chain.pipe_ref(f)` /
  `chain.pipe_mut(f)`), and flags a unary call heading a chain that
  pipes (suggests `x.pipe(g)`). All four checks default to enforce.

### Tests
- [`cfg-attr-ignore-tests.md`](./cfg-attr-ignore-tests.md) — prefer
  `#[cfg_attr(..., ignore = "...")]` over `#[cfg(...)]` on `#[test]`s, and
  require an `ignore` reason string.
- [`manual-json-string.md`](./manual-json-string.md) — in test
  code, when a string literal or `format!` invocation produces a
  non-trivial JSON document, prefer
  `serde_json::json!({ ... }).to_string()`. By default silent in
  production code (performance trade-off is reviewer's call;
  `restrict_to_tests = false` opts in) and in workspaces that
  do not depend on `serde_json` anywhere
  (`require_serde_json_dependency = false` opts in).

### String literals
- [`escaped-multiline-string.md`](./escaped-multiline-string.md) — when a string
  literal contains 2+ embedded `\n` newlines (and isn't a format
  template or display-attribute), prefer `text_block! { ... }` /
  `text_block_fnl! { ... }` (default) or the
  `"line\n\<newline>line"` continuation form. Skips templates and
  attribute literals.
- [`dedented-multiline-string.md`](./dedented-multiline-string.md) — the
  source-layout complement: when a string literal is broken across
  source lines by *raw* line breaks that drop its body out of the
  surrounding indentation (flush to the left margin), prefer
  `include_str!` of a sibling fixture file, a `text_block_fnl! { ... }`
  re-indented block, or — for a single logical line — a one-line
  `"…\n"`. Independent of `manual_json_string`: a dedented JSON
  literal trips both.
- [`overly-long-print-macro.md`](./overly-long-print-macro.md) — when a
  splittable print macro (`println!`, `eprintln!`, `writeln!`,
  log family, …) has an embedded-`\n` template *and* spans more
  than `max_line_width` columns, suggest either splitting into
  one call per line (`multiple_calls`, default) or folding the
  template with backslash-newline continuations
  (`line_continuation`). Excludes `format!`/`format_args!` and
  the panic/assert family because their behaviour changes under
  splitting.
- [`overly-long-format-macro.md`](./overly-long-format-macro.md) — counterpart
  for the *unsplittable* macros: `format!`, `format_args!`,
  `panic!`, `assert!` (with message), the `debug_assert*` family,
  `unimplemented!`/`todo!`/`unreachable!`. When the source line
  exceeds `max_line_width`, suggest folding the template with
  `\n\<newline>` continuations. Only one rewrite — multi-call is
  not viable for these macros.
- [`overly-long-derive-more-template.md`](./overly-long-derive-more-template.md)
  — same width-driven wrapping for derive_more attribute-form
  templates: `#[display(...)]`, `#[debug(...)]`. The attribute
  is consumed by a derive macro so multi-attribute splitting
  isn't viable; only line-continuation rewriting.

### Macros
- [`macro-trailing-comma.md`](./macro-trailing-comma.md) — apply
  rustfmt's `trailing_comma = "Vertical"` policy (trailing comma
  on multi-line argument lists, none on single-line) to
  function-like macro invocations (`ast::MacCall`), which
  rustfmt itself leaves untouched. Attribute-style invocations
  like `#[derive(...)]` are out of scope. Two eligibility modes:
  **name-based**, a curated list of core/std and well-known
  third-party macros (easy, configurable via
  `extra_macros`), and **matcher-based**, an automatic walk
  of `macro_rules!` matchers to detect the `$(,)?` / `$(,)*`
  optional-trailing-comma idioms (harder, not yet implemented
  and therefore not configurable).
- [`impure-macro-arguments.md`](./impure-macro-arguments.md) —
  require impure expressions passed to function-like and
  array-like macro invocations to be bound to a `let` first.
  Targets the `debug_assert_eq!(map.insert(k, v), None)` footgun
  (release builds skip evaluation entirely) and the general
  class of "macros don't promise exactly-once argument
  evaluation". Four `mode` values ordered by implementation
  cost: a tiny deny set of `debug_assert*`, an opt-in blanket
  ban, the default curated allow + deny sets, and
  matcher-based analysis for unknown `macro_rules!` macros that
  counts each `$name:expr` capture's `$name` references in the
  expansion. Curly-brace invocations are out of scope.

### Lazy initialization
- [`manual-lazy-init.md`](./manual-lazy-init.md) — flag a `Once*` cell
  whose entire usage is a fixed, non-capturing `get_or_init` (i.e. a
  hand-rolled `Lazy*`) and suggest the matching std type. Covers both
  pairs: `std::sync::OnceLock` → `LazyLock` (in a `static`) and
  `std::cell::OnceCell` → `LazyCell` (in a `thread_local!`). Stays
  silent on the cases `Lazy*` cannot express: values `set` from
  outside, initializers that capture runtime data, fallible
  `get_or_try_init`, and code that inspects the not-yet-initialised
  state. Active by default (requires the consumer's MSRV to permit
  `Lazy*`, i.e. Rust 1.80+).

### Serde
- [`serde-source-types.md`](./serde-source-types.md) — forbid
  `#[serde(from = "&'de str")]` / `try_from = "&'de str"`; advise
  `Cow<'de, str>` or `String`.
- [`serde-wrapper-form-mismatch.md`](./serde-wrapper-form-mismatch.md) — when a
  single-field wrapper has trivial `From` / `Into` impls,
  `#[serde(transparent)]` and `#[serde(from = "T", into = "T")]`
  produce the same wire format. The lint enforces a project-wide
  choice between the two (`transparent` for zero-cost,
  `from_into` to keep a validation hook ready). Inactive by
  default; opt in and choose `transparent` or `from_into`.

### Documentation
- [`em-dash-prose.md`](./em-dash-prose.md) — flag em dashes in doc comments
  and string literals reachable from `format!` / `println!` style macros.
- [`commit-id-length-mismatch.md`](./commit-id-length-mismatch.md) — enforce a
  consistent SHA length for commit IDs that appear in forge URLs.
  Covers file references, single-commit views (`/commit/<sha>`),
  and range comparisons (`/compare/<sha>...<sha>`). Defaults are
  permissive (any length passes); a project tightens the window to
  pin a fixed length such as 12 or 40.

### Lint-level attributes
- [`lint-downgrade-without-reason.md`](./lint-downgrade-without-reason.md) —
  same presence-and-length requirement as
  `perfectionist::allow_attributes_without_reason`, extended to any
  `#[warn]` / `#[allow]` / `#[expect]` that lowers the lint's
  inherited level (`deny → warn`, `warn → allow`, etc.).
  Ancestry-aware counterpart.

### Clap derive help
- [`clap-help-too-long.md`](./clap-help-too-long.md) — flag clap-bound doc
  comments that exceed configurable line / character budgets (catches
  AI-generated bloat). Shares the clap-derived-container detection and
  the override set with the implemented
  `perfectionist::clap_help_markdown`
  ([`src/rules/clap_help_markdown/collect.rs`](../src/rules/clap_help_markdown/collect.rs)).

## Out of scope (cannot be linted by Dylint)

The following rules from the source documents either describe processes,
external state, or judgement calls that a static lint cannot evaluate:

- **Conventional Commits format** for git messages — lives in commit
  metadata, not source. Use a `commit-msg` hook or CI check.
- **Run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test`** before submitting —
  CI / pre-commit concerns, not source patterns.
- **Build with no, default, and all features** — driven by CI matrix.
- **Writing-style rules** beyond em dashes (formal tone, complete sentences,
  no long parentheticals) — judgement-based prose review.
- **"Use the most encompassing type" case** of the pacquet guide's
  owned-vs-borrowed section is already covered by
  `clippy::ptr_arg` (flags `&PathBuf` / `&String` / `&Vec<_>` and
  suggests `&Path` / `&str` / `&[_]`). The other two cases
  (prefer-owned-when-converting and
  prefer-borrowed-when-not-consumed) are handled respectively by
  [`needless-borrowed-parameters`](./needless-borrowed-parameters.md) and
  `clippy::needless_pass_by_value`.
- **Reporter wire-contract requirements** in pacquet (channel naming,
  upstream permalink comments, ordering relative to side effects, recording
  fakes in tests) — these depend on cross-repo invariants and human
  judgement about the upstream call site.
- **Pattern-match wrapping style** — the "concise wrapping style" example
  is already idiomatic and there is no concrete anti-pattern to detect.
- **Test logging guidance** (`assert_eq!` with multi-line strings should
  log via `eprintln!`, complex structures via `dbg!`) — the rule branches
  on the runtime *shape* of values, which a static lint cannot inspect.
- **Cloning `Arc` / `Rc` via `.clone()`** (pacquet *Cloning `Arc` and
  `Rc`*) — covered by `clippy::clone_on_ref_ptr`, which flags
  `x.clone()` on a ref-counted pointer and suggests the qualified
  `Arc::clone(&x)` / `Rc::clone(&x)` form. It is a `restriction` lint
  (allow-by-default); enable `clone_on_ref_ptr = "warn"` under
  `[lints.clippy]`. A dedicated lint would only duplicate it and would
  have to coordinate to avoid double-firing.
- **Flat module layout** (`foo.rs`, never `foo/mod.rs`) — covered by
  `clippy::mod_module_files`, a `restriction` lint (allow-by-default)
  that warns on every `mod.rs` file (requiring the self-named `foo.rs`
  form instead). Enable `mod_module_files = "warn"` under
  `[lints.clippy]`; this crate does so in its own `Cargo.toml`. (The
  lint names are counter-intuitive — each is named for what it *warns
  about*, not what it enforces. The *opposite* lint,
  `clippy::self_named_module_files`, warns on self-named files and so
  requires the contradictory `mod.rs` layout — never enable both.)
- **Doc comments referencing items more private than the documented item**
  (pacquet *Documentation comments*) — already covered by rustdoc's
  built-in `rustdoc::private_intra_doc_links` lint (default `warn`).
  Run `RUSTFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc --document-private-items` to
  promote it to a hard error. `perfectionist::bare_identifier_reference`
  (`src/rules/bare_identifier_reference.rs`) deliberately leaves a public item's
  bare-backtick mention of a more-private item alone — turning it into
  `` [`Foo`] `` would only manufacture a `private_intra_doc_links`
  violation — so this case stays out of scope here too, covered only by
  rustdoc's lint for the explicit-link form. Reimplementing it in Dylint
  would be a less accurate duplicate of rustdoc's own resolver.
