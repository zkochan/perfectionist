//! UI test for `uncombined_self_import`. The rule is inactive by default,
//! so the test points at its fixture directory under
//! `ui-toml/uncombined_self_import/` and passes a `dylint.toml` that
//! enables it.
//!
//! `import_granularity_mismatch` is disabled in the config: it is active by
//! default and would also fire on these fixtures (which deliberately use
//! crate-style nested `use`s), so disabling it keeps the snapshot
//! focused on `uncombined_self_import`.
