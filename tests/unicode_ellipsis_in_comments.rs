//! Cross-rule UI test for `unicode_ellipsis_in_comments`. The
//! default-config sweep lives in `ui/unicode_ellipsis_in_comments.rs`
//! and is picked up by `tests/ui.rs`; that fixture is deliberately
//! limited to `//` and `/* */` comments so it exercises only this
//! rule. The test below points at a fixture under
//! `ui-toml/unicode_ellipsis_in_comments/` and disables the sibling
//! `unicode_ellipsis_in_docs` rule via the `[perfectionist]` global
//! table, so the doc-comment lines in that fixture isolate the claim
//! that the comment rule does not intrude into doc comments.
//!
//! `Test::dylint_toml` works by setting the `DYLINT_TOML` env var for
//! the duration of `run_tests`. The env var is process-global, so the
//! `#[test]`s in this binary serialise themselves on a shared [`Mutex`]
//! to avoid clobbering each other under the default parallel test
//! harness.
