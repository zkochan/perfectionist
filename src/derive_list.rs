//! Reading the trait names out of a `#[derive(...)]` list.
//!
//! [`derive_names`] collects the final path segment of every derived
//! trait on a node, looking through `#[cfg_attr(<cfg>, derive(...))]` —
//! a gated derive still governs what its helper attributes mean wherever
//! it applies. Matching by final segment catches `some_crate::Trait`, a
//! plain `Trait` imported from it, and a same-name re-export; a derive
//! renamed through `use some_crate::Trait as T;` is not caught.
//!
//! Read from tokens rather than parsed meta-items so it works on a
//! re-parsed module AST. [`derive_entries`] is the underlying read of
//! one `derive(...)` list, and hands back each entry's span alongside
//! its name for a caller that rewrites the list rather than only asking
//! which traits are derived.
