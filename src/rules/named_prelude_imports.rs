//! `perfectionist::named_prelude_imports` — flag cherry-picked named
//! imports from a `prelude` module (`use serde::prelude::Serialize;`),
//! leaving the glob form (`use serde::prelude::*;`) alone.
//!
//! Unlike the source-layout import rules (`import_granularity_mismatch`,
//! `import_grouping_mismatch`, `uncombined_self_import`, `wildcard_imports`), this rule is a
//! plain HIR [`LateLintPass`] rather than a re-parsing one. Two reasons:
//!
//! - Its autofix rewrites the import to the item's *canonical* module,
//!   which is resolved from the item's `DefId` — information that only
//!   exists for items the compiler actually resolved, i.e. not for
//!   `#[cfg(...)]`-disabled code a re-parse would additionally reach.
//! - A HIR walk already reaches every compiled module, including
//!   separate-file `mod foo;` submodules; the re-parse machinery exists
//!   to recover *cfg-disabled* and *un-merged* written layout, neither of
//!   which this rule needs. (HIR lowers `use a::{b, c}` into one
//!   [`UseKind::Single`] item per leaf, so each cherry-picked name is
//!   flagged individually with no flattening of our own.)
//!
//! Lowering does drop one thing the fix needs: which leaves were
//! written as one statement. A brace-list leaf's path span holds only
//! its name, so the rewrite has to rebuild the statement's whole use
//! tree (see [`statement`]). The desugaring emits a statement's
//! `ListStem` ahead of its leaves and nests every leaf span inside the
//! stem's, so the pass rebuilds that grouping as it walks: a `use` item
//! the current statement's span does not contain starts the next one.

    /// ### What it does
    ///
    /// Flags a `use` statement that cherry-picks a named item out of a
    /// `prelude` module (`use serde::prelude::Serialize;`) and leaves the
    /// glob form (`use serde::prelude::*;`) alone. The set of segment
    /// names treated as preludes is configurable via
    /// `prelude_segment_names` (default `["prelude"]`), and individual
    /// prelude paths can be exempted with `allowed_paths`.
    ///
    /// This is the dual of `perfectionist::wildcard_imports`: that rule
    /// restricts globs in general but lets preludes glob freely, while
    /// this rule restricts named imports *from* a prelude and lets the
    /// glob form through.
    ///
    /// ### Why restrict this?
    ///
    /// This is a stylistic preference, not a correctness issue. A
    /// `prelude` module is, by convention, a curated set of items the
    /// crate author decided should always travel together as a glob.
    /// Cherry-picking individual items from a prelude defeats that
    /// intent and usually means the importer should reach into the
    /// prelude's source module instead.
    ///
    /// One rewrite covers the whole `use`: a statement with several
    /// cherry-picks carries it once, and a `help` on the rest. Where
    /// the rewrite cannot be shown to preserve what the `use` binds,
    /// only the `help` is offered.
    ///
    /// ### Example
    ///
    /// **Avoid:**
    ///
    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// use serde::prelude::Serialize;
    /// use diesel::prelude::{table, AsChangeset};
    /// ```
    ///
    /// **Prefer:**
    ///
    /// _From the canonical module:_ import each item where it actually lives.
    ///
    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// use serde::Serialize;
    /// use diesel::{table, AsChangeset};
    /// ```
    ///
    /// _As a prelude glob:_ pull in the whole curated set at once.
    ///
    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// use diesel::prelude::*;
    /// ```
