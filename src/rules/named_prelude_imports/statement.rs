//! The `use` statement currently being walked, and the rewrite that
//! re-points its cherry-picked leaves at their canonical modules.
//!
//! `rustc_ast_lowering` desugars `use foo::{A, B};` into one HIR item
//! per leaf, so a leaf's own path span covers just its name inside the
//! braces. That span cannot be rewritten in place: the `foo::` prefix
//! is shared with the other leaves, which need not agree on a canonical
//! module, and a nested `use` entry may not start at `crate` or
//! `super`. The rewrite therefore rebuilds the statement's use tree
//! from the leaves.
//!
//! Where that rebuilt tree goes depends on the shape lowering left
//! behind. A single import keeps a path span covering its whole path,
//! so the tree replaces just that — and the `as` rename, which sits
//! outside it, survives untouched. A brace list keeps no span for its
//! tree at all (the head's path span stops at the shared prefix), so
//! the statement is re-rendered whole, carrying its visibility across.
//! Either span starts no earlier than the visibility, so a statement's
//! attributes are outside the rewrite and need no reproducing — which
//! matters most for a `#[cfg(...)]`, since cfg-stripping means a
//! lowered item no longer records that it had one.
//!
//! [`Statement`] accumulates the leaves as the pass walks them and
//! [`Statement::rewrite`] renders the replacement.
