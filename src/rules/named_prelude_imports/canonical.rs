//! Resolving the canonical module a cherry-picked prelude item
//! actually lives in.
//!
//! A prelude is a module of re-exports, so the path a `use` writes says
//! nothing about where the item is declared. The canonical path is
//! built from the item's *definition* path, which bypasses every
//! re-export on the way and lands on the declaring module.
//!
//! A definition path is not always a path the importer may *write*.
//! Two ways it is not, each of which produced a rewrite that does not
//! compile before this module weighed them — and which are answered
//! differently, because they are wrong to different depths:
//!
//! - **The defining crate need not be linked here.** `std`'s prelude
//!   re-exports items defined in `alloc`, so `use std::prelude::v1::Vec;`
//!   has the definition path `alloc::vec::Vec` — and `alloc` is not in
//!   the extern prelude of an ordinary crate. Any facade crate
//!   re-exporting from a private sibling behaves the same way. The
//!   module named is still the right one, so the path is offered and
//!   only [`Canonical::nameable`] is withheld.
//! - **A definition path names its crate unrooted.** An import written
//!   `use ::dep::prelude::Item;` pinned `dep` to the extern prelude;
//!   rewriting it to `dep::thing::Item` drops the pin, so a module
//!   named `dep` at the rewrite site captures the path instead. The
//!   leading `::` is put back rather than the path withheld.
//! - **A macro's definition path need not be the path it answers to.** A
//!   `#[macro_export] macro_rules!` written inside `mod thing` has the
//!   definition path `crate::thing::shout`, but resolves only as
//!   `crate::shout`. Here the module named is simply wrong, so no path
//!   is offered at all rather than a suggestion that reads as fact.
