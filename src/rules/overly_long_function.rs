    /// ### What it does
    ///
    /// Counts the lines of code in a function or method body and flags
    /// the body when the count is above `max_lines`.
    ///
    /// A line counts when it holds anything other than whitespace and
    /// comments, so blank lines, comment-only lines, doc comments, and
    /// the lines a block comment spans are free. The braces that open and close
    /// the body are not counted. A function produced by a macro is not
    /// measured. A nested function's lines count towards the function
    /// that contains it, since they sit in its body.
    ///
    /// Test code is measured like any other code; set
    /// `exempt_tests` to leave it alone.
    ///
    /// ### Why restrict this?
    ///
    /// This is a stylistic preference, not a correctness issue. A
    /// function that runs past a screen is read in pieces, and the
    /// reader has to hold the pieces they have scrolled past. A cap on
    /// length is the plainest of the size measures, and the one that
    /// catches a body that is long without being complex — a sequence
    /// of straight-line steps, each of which would read better as a
    /// function named for what it does.
    ///
    /// ### Interaction with Clippy
    ///
    /// `clippy::too_many_lines` (`pedantic`, off by default) measures
    /// the same thing, but it measures a function produced by a macro
    /// defined in the same crate and skips only what another crate's
    /// macro produced, where this rule skips every generated function,
    /// whose line count tracks the macro body's layout rather than
    /// what a reader scrolls through. Clippy also has no exemption for
    /// test code, and its default cap is 100. This rule exists so a
    /// project can hold its functions to the same limit it holds their
    /// complexity and their local bindings to, with the same knobs.
    /// Enable one or the other, not both.
    ///
    /// ### Example
    ///
    /// **Avoid:** a body that reads, validates, transforms, and writes
    /// in one run of eighty lines.
    ///
    /// **Prefer:** a body of four calls, each to a function that reads,
    /// validates, transforms, or writes.
