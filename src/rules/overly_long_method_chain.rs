    /// ### What it does
    ///
    /// Counts the distinct method calls in one expression chain —
    /// `a.b().c().d()` is three — and flags the chain when the count
    /// is above `max_calls` (default `5`).
    ///
    /// Only method calls on the chain's spine count: the receiver of
    /// each call, down to the value the chain starts from. A run of the
    /// same method — `.arg("-v").arg("build").arg(path)` — counts once,
    /// so a builder is measured by its distinct calls. A `?` or an
    /// `.await` between two calls neither counts nor breaks the chain.
    /// A field access (`self.items.iter()` starts at `self.items`) and
    /// a function call (`Vec::new().push(1)` starts at `Vec::new()`)
    /// end the spine. A closure's body is measured on its own, so a
    /// chain inside a `map(|item| ...)` is a chain of its own. A chain
    /// produced by a macro expansion is not measured.
    ///
    /// Test code is measured like any other code; set
    /// `exempt_tests` to leave it alone.
    ///
    /// Where a chain stops being readable is a matter of taste, and a
    /// codebase written around iterator pipelines will disagree with
    /// one written around named intermediates. The rule is therefore
    /// inactive by default — enable it per crate by adding to
    /// `dylint.toml`:
    ///
    /// ```toml
    /// [perfectionist]
    /// enable = ["overly_long_method_chain"]
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ### Why restrict this?
    ///
    /// This is a stylistic preference, not a correctness issue. A long
    /// chain is a pipeline whose intermediate values have no names, so
    /// the reader has to infer what each stage produces from the method
    /// that consumes it. Up to a handful of stages that is what makes
    /// iterator code read well; past that, the reader is holding a
    /// stack of anonymous types. Binding a stage to a `let` named for
    /// what it holds, or moving a run of stages into a function named
    /// for what it does, gives the reader the name the chain withheld.
    ///
    /// ### Example
    ///
    /// **Avoid:**
    ///
    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// let names = manifest
    ///     .dependencies
    ///     .iter()
    ///     .filter(|(_, spec)| spec.is_workspace())
    ///     .map(|(name, _)| name.as_str())
    ///     .filter(|name| !name.starts_with('@'))
    ///     .map(str::to_owned)
    ///     .collect::<Vec<_>>()
    ///     .join(", ");
    /// ```
    ///
    /// **Prefer:**
    ///
    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// let workspace_deps = manifest
    ///     .dependencies
    ///     .iter()
    ///     .filter(|(_, spec)| spec.is_workspace())
    ///     .map(|(name, _)| name.as_str());
    /// let unscoped: Vec<String> = workspace_deps
    ///     .filter(|name| !name.starts_with('@'))
    ///     .map(str::to_owned)
    ///     .collect();
    /// let names = unscoped.join(", ");
    /// ```
